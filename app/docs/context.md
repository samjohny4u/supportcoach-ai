## CURRENT TASK
- None active — deciding next priority

## REMAINING BEFORE PRODUCTION LAUNCH
1. **UI design polish** — fonts, colors, theme consistency (user exploring shadcn/ui and Tremor)
2. **Stripe billing integration** — products, prices, checkout, webhooks, plan gating
3. **Production deployment** — Vercel or Railway, environment setup, domain

## KNOWN ISSUES / BLOCKERS
- AI team summary may still produce Unicode bullet characters — the API route strips them but the prompt also instructs plain ASCII
- First save on settings page shows NEXT_REDIRECT before working on second click — minor, not blocking

## KEY DECISIONS MADE
- Manager-insights route removed (duplicated existing routes)
- Soft delete via `excluded` boolean, not hard delete
- Template-based pattern card narratives, not AI-generated (v1)
- Response time threshold: under 2 min = normal, 2-4 min = notable, over 4 min = coaching point
- Timestamps only cited when timing is actually a coaching point — not as decoration
- Coaching openings must vary naturally — no repetitive patterns
- Pre-formatted structured transcripts sent to AI instead of raw PDF text
- knownSenderNames set for handling inconsistent PDF spacing
- Company coaching context: manager-provided process knowledge injected into AI prompt per org
- Per-chat re-analyze: one chat at a time, no bulk — intentional cost control
- Two-layer API integration strategy: full metadata ingest + selective AI analysis (Section 10c)
- RLS enabled on all tables. Service role key bypasses RLS. Application-level org filtering maintained as defense-in-depth.
- If a fix attempt fails, STOP. Do not cascade fixes.

## FILES THAT MUST NOT BREAK
- `src/app/api/process-jobs/route.ts` — the core worker
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — main dashboard
- `src/app/api/create-analysis-job/route.ts` — upload pipeline
- `src/lib/currentOrganization.ts` — org resolution for multi-tenancy

## DOCUMENTS TO READ ON NEW THREAD
1. `docs/RULES.md` — standing orders (read first, always)
2. `docs/CONTEXT.md` — this file
3. `docs/codex-orchestration.md` — completed task list (reference only)
4. `docs/supportcoach-ai-context.md` — full master prompt

## NEW THREAD STARTER MESSAGE
"I'm continuing development of SupportCoach AI. Read docs/RULES.md and docs/CONTEXT.md for current status. Three items remain: UI design polish, Stripe billing, and production deployment."
